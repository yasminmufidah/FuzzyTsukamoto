# Marine Risk Prediction using Fuzzy Tsukamoto

Introduction:
This project employs the Fuzzy Tsukamoto method to predict the risk associated with maritime voyages, enhancing decision-making processes in marine navigation. Additionally, we provide a user-friendly Python Tkinter interface that allows users to input voyage parameters and obtain risk predictions conveniently.

Project Overview:
Marine navigation involves complex decision-making, and predicting voyage risks accurately is vital for safety and efficiency. This project leverages the power of Fuzzy Tsukamoto to analyze various factors and offer informed risk assessments for maritime voyages.
